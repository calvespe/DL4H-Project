# Folders and descriptions

## Jung_base
This folder contains their original code base for their model editted to work with input files created by our code. Their input requires a pkl file. Code to create this pkl file from the raw csv file is provided in this folder in Zeros_Data_Processing_Jung.ipynb.
### Running files in this folder
First file to be run is Zeros_Data_Processing_Jung.ipynb, which can be run through Juypter Notebooks. This will output a pkl file, which will be used as input to the model in the following command:  
python main.py --dataset='Zero' --data_path=PATH --kfold=5 --impute_weigh=0.1 --reg_weight=0.5 --label_weight=0.5 --gamma=5.0 --cognitive_score=True  
Replace path with path to pkl when running

## Jung_modified
This folder contains our additional experiment. It uses their base code with our additions of demographic and genetic features. Their input requires a pkl file. Code to create this pkl file from the raw csv file is provided in this folder in Zeros_Data_Processing_Jung.ipynb.
### Running files in this folder
First file to be run is Zeros_Data_Processing_Jung.ipynb, which can be run through Juypter Notebooks. This will output a pkl file, which will be used as input to the model in the following command:  
python main.py --dataset='Zero' --data_path=PATH --kfold=5 --impute_weigh=0.1 --reg_weight=0.5 --label_weight=0.5 --gamma=5.0 --cognitive_score=True  
Replace path with path to pkl when running

## LSTM_baselines 
This folder contains two data processing files, which are the .ipynb files that take in a csv file and create pkl files. The .py files do the training and testing given the pkl files created by the data processing files.
### Running files in this folder
Both .ipynb files can be run using jupyter notebooks. They output pkl files, which can be run by the .py files using the following commands:  
python LSTM_cognitive_scores.py  
python LSTM_diagnosis.py
